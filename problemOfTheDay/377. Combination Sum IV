Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target.

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [9], target = 3
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 200
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
All the elements of nums are unique.
1 <= target <= 1000

        }
        
        // Store and return the computed result.
        return dp[remainingTarget] = currentCombinations;
    }

        // Initialize the 'dp' array with -1 to indicate uncomputed results.

            dp[i] = -1;
        }
